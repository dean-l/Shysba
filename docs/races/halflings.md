# Halflings

Halflings are a semi nomadic race, living away from most cities in their own temporary communes. Living off the land, they plant seasonal gardens and crops where suitable and leave the harvest for the next travelling community. None of the tribes really own any of the gardens, they are all just looked after for the good of the halfling community as a whole. When a garden starts to get overharvested, they move on to another one, but make sure to plant more seeds before they go. Ones that have been untended for a long period are eventually remade. A number of these communities find work at farms around Doloria during harvest seasons. Farmers welcome the help of these hardworking and skilled communities, and supply them with food and provisions for their continued journey.

Along with roaming the country side and living off the land, halflings are avid collectors and enjoy finding trinkets and items from the many different cultures all over Doloria. Most of these items make their way back to Mother's Grotto to be added to the immense collection, save for a few sentimental pieces. Halflings will almost always carry many items tied to perilous adventures, grand parties or distant loved ones.

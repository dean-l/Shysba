# The Cult of the Dragons

The Cult of the Dragons is a group obsessed with restoring the former glory of the dragons and punishing those they deem to be threat to that. They believe that the gift of magic was never meant for the common races and that the rule of the dragons was necessary. They believe in discipline and servitude and strive for the dragons to rightly rule again.

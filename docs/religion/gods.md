# The Gods

Religion is an important part of life in the world, and most people worship a god of some kind. Before the gods left the world, they walked among the common people, sharing their knowledge and their power. Some became enamoured by this simple way of life and raised families with their mortal loves. These part mortal, part divine children often became gods in their own right, worshipped by their decendants. Most of these deities are obscure and secular, but the original gods are widely worshipped and known around the lands.

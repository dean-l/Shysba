# The Empire

The wizards Krolos and Kankunarn found the Thaland Empire in the pursuit of knowlegde. Their shared quest for knowledge spears a grand conquest and creates a legion of human and elven followers on a quest to unite the world.

# The Ordained Emperii of Thaland

Ruling the Empire are two representatives, one of noble human birth selected by the Eldemere Council and one of elven heritage chosen by the Aiedaeil sages. These leaders work in concert to extend the helping hand of the empire to new lands.

As the Empire grew and generations between humans and elves began to mismatch with the disparate lifespans, Shysban council decided that for the death or abdicatation of a human emperor, the elves would reselect their emperor within the Shysban Dugui, regardless of popularity or political stability

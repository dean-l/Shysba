# The Great Libraries

Built on the islands to the south away from inteference from opportunistic nations, the Great Libraries stand as a pure archive of the knowledge of the world. Although each exists as the ultimate collection of one discipline, the lines between responsibility are often blurred and ownership of some important pieces have been in contention for decades.

| Library | Discipline | Island |
|:-|:-|:-|
| The Hall of Truth | Laws | Ratan |
| Manai Nomuud | History | Deskin |
| Brovind's Collection | Art | Fander Bon |
| The Magilex | Magic | Drist |

## The Hall of Truth

The Hall of Truth has a record of every piece of legislation, law and edict and handles trial and prosecution of the most notorious criminals. The Hall is run by the Overseers, who enforce as many laws as they keep.

## Manai Nomuud

All the worlds events and tales have been passed down through the centuries by the Elders at Manai Nomuud, and recorded into their archives. While respected and immensibly knowedgable, their stories are complex and often contradictory.

## Brovind's Collection

The guilded rooms of Brovind's Collection house some of the finest treasures, artworks and artifacts in the world. The Curators maintain a watchful eye over the collection and are very secretive about new acquisitions and changes.

## The Magilex

With some of the greatest wizards in it's employ, the Magilex is on the cutting edge of magical research. Constant experimentation and a lack of respect for procedure constantly put the Mages at odds with the other libraries.

# The College of Masons

As the oldest of the trade houses, the College of Masons is one of the most esteemed and trusted organisations accross the sea. Formed by the masons that designed and constructed the Wotan Canal, they pride themselves on engineering excellence. Pedantic and peticular, the masons have a way they do things which can be tiring for those unfamuliar, but the quality of their work speaks for itself.

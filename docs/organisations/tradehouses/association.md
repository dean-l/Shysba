# The Wide Sea Association

Starting as a loose group of dwarven ship crews, the Wide Sea Association is now the largest tradehouse, spanning from the Buthran to eastern Thaland. Handling shipbuilding, trade routes and most ports, the Association is the beginning and end of all that travels over the Wide Sea.

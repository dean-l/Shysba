Formed in Eldemere as a training academy for soldiers and guards, Breventon is one of the most most respected and premier security forces accross the Wide Sea. The powerful and wealthy will most often have a guard of Breventon knights at their side, as first class protection comes at a first class price. Recently their association with the Empire and its more powerful members has cast doubts on the position of neutrality required by all tradehouses. Some have called for an investigation into these allegations but no evidence has been found.

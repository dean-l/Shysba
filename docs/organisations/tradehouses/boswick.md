# The Boswick Players

The newest tradehouse, the Boswick Players have quickly made a name for themselves as the premier hosts of plays, music and performance. Run by Gallop Boswick and his sister Lady Eunith Boswick-Haapt, members of The Players can be found in taverns, circuses and noble courts all over the world.

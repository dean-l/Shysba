# Naiju-Alstott

To successfully circumnavicate the Buthran and construct what would become the Etsegiin Road, explorers Usman Naiju and Herman Alstott II hired an array of local craftspeople to map, clear and maintain the road. After it's completion, most of the construction camps remained and those that built the road began working as caravaneers and couriers. Over the next few decades, a word-of-mouth network formed of those that helped "Naiju and Alstott" and by the time the community had become strong enough to become a tradehouse, the name had stuck.

Established as a small fishing village and rebuilt as a duchy capital after the disappearance of Sonder, Whitemarsh has planted itself as the gateway to Shysba, fostering trade and diplomancy over the Wide Sea. Home to Desiria and Naiju-Alstott, the city is a bustling independent centre of outside of the empire.

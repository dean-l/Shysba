# Rendraw City

Established as a simple lakeside fishing village, it rose to prosperity with the discovery of oil rich fields to the east. Establishing trade routes to Karandul’s Landing and Inverhölm, Rendraw City quickly made itself a small fortune and the leaders set about making it a must see destination for travellers. It soon made a name for itself as a haven for every carnal desire and wicked vice any being could want. The creation of Judgement to the south did little to stifle the questionable aspects of the town, and is instead wielded as a threat to those naive enough to take advantage of the Gilded Trust.

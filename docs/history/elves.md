# Arrival of the Elves

## 0 лелћ

Decended from the fey Eladrin, the elves appeared in the north east several thousand years after the gods had disappeared. This also most likely brings about the beginning of recorded history.

The elves bring with them the magic of the fey and begin practising the ways of Shysba. The affect of the fey magic on the land will not be felt for several centuries.

The elves begin to record time as 'Shysban Dugui', a spiritual period of natural time lasting approximately 6 Imperial Years.

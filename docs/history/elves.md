# Arrival of the Elves

Decended from the fey Eladrin, the elves appeared in the north east after the gods had dissapeared. This also most likely brings about the beginning of recorded history.

The elves bring with them the magic of the fey and begin practising the ways of Shysba, the effects of which will not be felt for several centuries.

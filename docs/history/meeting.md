# The Races Meet

## 18 лелћ

As the races grow and nations extend their reach over the seas, the discovery of another peoples soon followed. While early relations between the humans and elves are democratic, as more territory and resourses are traded and shared, so are differing ideas. Tensions rise and reach a boiling point, culminating in the War of the Islands.

The tradehouses are created to standardise pricing and fulfill supply fairly and honestly across all nations.

The ports of Shysba are connected to the existing trade routes with the construction of the Wotan Canal, joining the Buthran with the Wide Sea.

The wise and stoic Loxodon abandon their old ways on the plains and pick up nomadic lives to share their knowledge with the other races. Through their travels and discussion with the mages around the world, their magical techniques are discovered to originate from the mages of Sonder, spurring the reinvention of SOnderism. The Loxodon knowledge is recorded by [author ?].

# Sonder Sinks into the Wide Sea

In an unexplained and sudden event, the elven island of Sonder sinks below the waves, taking all of it's citizens down with it with the exception of a handful of navy ships and a ferry carrying the Grand Duke.

In a show of support, the people of the neighbouring costal town of Whitemarsh gift their small fishing town to the elves as the new seat of the duchy.

All sonderan records, magical technology and the mages that created them are lost.
